## Overview

This repository provides the MATLAB scripts used to:
1.  Implement the analytical solution for the nonlinear postbuckling analysis of Functionally Graded Graphene Origami-Enabled Auxetic Metamaterial (FG-GOEAM) plates resting on a Kerr elastic foundation. The model is based on Reddy's Higher-Order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT) and von Kármán's geometric nonlinearity.
2.  Generate a dataset from this analytical solution.
3.  Train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models (using Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithms) to predict the postbuckling load-deflection coefficients ($\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \lambda_2$).
The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated analytical-ANN approach for efficient and accurate prediction of complex postbuckling behavior.

## Key Features

*   MATLAB implementation of the HSDT-based analytical solution for FG-GOEAM plate postbuckling.
*   Calculation and plotting of normalized load-deflection curves ($\overline{\lambda}$ vs $\overline{W}$).
*   Scripts for training ANN models to predict the three postbuckling coefficients.

## Dataset Description

*   `Uniaxial_X.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the training data for X-WGr plate under uniaxial compression.
    *   **Columns 1-8 (Inputs):** These correspond to the `var1` to `var8` parameters defined in `Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m`. These typically represent:
        1.  `var1`: Plate aspect ratio parameter (e.g., `a/h` related)
        2.  `var2`: Plate aspect ratio parameter (e.g., `b/a` related)
        3.  `var3`: Temperature (T)
        4.  `var4`: Degree of GOri folding (HGr)
        5.  `var5`: GOri weight fraction (WGr)
        6.  `var6`: Kerr foundation parameter (Kun)
        7.  `var7`: Kerr foundation parameter (Ksn)
        8.  `var8`: Kerr foundation parameter (Kln)
    *   **Columns 9-11 (Targets):** These are the non-dimensional postbuckling coefficients derived from the analytical solution:
        1.  `lambda_0` (Normalized critical buckling load)
        2.  `lambda_1` (Coefficient of the linear term of normalized deflection)
        3.  `lambda_2` (Coefficient of the quadratic term of normalized deflection)

This dataset is generated by systematically running the analytical solution in `Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m` for various combinations of input parameters.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Analytical Solution (`Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m`)

This script calculates and plots the postbuckling load-deflection curve for a given set of input parameters.

1.  Open `Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m` in MATLAB.
2.  Modify the input parameters (`var1` to `var8`) in the "Input Parameters" section as required for your analysis.
3.  Select the loading case (Uniaxial or Biaxial Compression) by uncommenting the appropriate `Chi1` and `Chi2` lines.
4.  Adjust material distribution patterns within `GOri_distribution.m`
5.  Run the script (`F5` or click "Run").
6.  A plot of the normalized load-deflection curve ($\overline{\lambda}$ vs $\overline{W}$) will be generated. 

**To generate a dataset for ANN training:**
You would typically need to wrap the core calculation logic of `Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m` inside a loop. In each iteration, vary the input parameters (`var1` through `var8`), run the analytical solution, and save the input parameters along with the computed `Lambda0`, `Lambda1`, and `Lambda2` to a data file (e.g., an Excel sheet). The provided `Main_FGOEAM_Plate.m` is set up for a single run.

### 2. ANN Training (`ANN_Training.m`)

This script trains an Artificial Neural Network model using data from an Excel file (e.g., `Uniaxial_X.xlsx`).

1.  Ensure your dataset (e.g., `Uniaxial_X.xlsx`) is in the MATLAB path or the current directory.
2.  Open `ANN_Training.m` in MATLAB.
3.  Select the desired ANN training algorithm (Bayesian Regularization, Levenberg-Marquardt, or Scaled Conjugate Gradient) by uncommenting the relevant `net = fitnet(...)` line.
4.  Adjust network architecture (e.g., `hiddenLayerSizes`), transfer functions, data division ratios (`net.divideParam`), and training parameters (`net.trainParam`) as needed.
5.  Run the script.
6.  The script will train the ANN and save the trained network (`net`) and training record (`tr`) to a `.mat` file (e.g., `LM_Uniaxial_X.mat`). Training progress plots may also be displayed.


### 3. Using a Trained ANN Model for Prediction  (`Load_Trained_ANN_model.m`)

The `Load_Trained_ANN_model.m` script uses a pre-trained ANN model (e.g., `BR_Uniaxial_U.mat`) to predict postbuckling coefficients and plot the load-deflection curve.

**To use:**
1.  Ensure the trained `.mat` model file (e.g., `BR_Uniaxial_U.mat`) is in your MATLAB path.
2.  Open `Load_Trained_ANN_model.m`.
3.  Modify `var1` through `var8` at the top of the script with your desired input parameters.
4.  Run the script (`F5`).

**Output:**
*   The script will predict `Lambda0`, `Lambda1`, and `Lambda2`.
*   A plot of the predicted normalized load-deflection curve ($\overline{\lambda}$ vs $\overline{W}$) will be displayed.
